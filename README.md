## Website Design

This repository hosts multiple website designs.  

Although I am not a designer, I created websites(LP and Corporate Site) to understand design and designers.  

These are all created for learning purposes, and in consideration of copyrights and confidentiality, client work deliverables are not included.

You can check each design in the lps and websites directories.
